# AdaptX

## Description :

AdaptX is a modular autonomous system designed for seamless integration with various robotic platforms. Currently, it is being developed using an RC car as a test platform, enabling autonomous navigation, mapping, and object detection. Powered by Jetson Nano, X2 RPLiDAR, and Raspberry Pi V2 Camera, AdaptX leverages cutting-edge AI and SLAM technologies to achieve real-time perception and decision-making.

With a web-based interface built using Flask, users can remotely start and manage key processes such as LiDAR-based mapping and camera-based object detection. The system provides live streaming of object detection and Hector SLAM mapping, making it a versatile solution for robotics and automation applications.

Key Features :<br> 
✅ Autonomous Navigation – SLAM-based path planning and obstacle avoidance.<br>
✅ Mapping – Real-time mapping using Hector SLAM.<br>
✅ Object Detection – YOLO-powered object recognition.<br>
✅ Web Control Interface – Start/stop processes via a Flask-based dashboard.<br>
✅ Live Streaming – View object detection and SLAM mapping on the web.
